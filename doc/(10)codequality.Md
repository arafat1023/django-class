# Code Quality and Linting for Django Projects
## Setting Up Code Quality Tools

### 1. Install Required Tools
Use pip to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install pylint flake8 black
```

### 2. Running Pylint
Pylint is a comprehensive tool for checking code against coding standards.

#### Create a Configuration File (Optional)
Generate a configuration file for Pylint:

```bash
pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc
```

Modify the `.pylintrc` file as needed to customize checks.

#### Running Pylint
Run Pylint on your Django app:

```bash
pylint appname
```

It will produce a report highlighting errors, warnings, and suggestions.

### 3. Running Flake8
Flake8 is a lightweight linting tool to enforce PEP 8 standards.

#### Create a Configuration File (Optional)
Generate a configuration file for Flake8:

```bash
echo "[flake8]\nmax-line-length = 88" > .flake8
```

#### Running Flake8
Run Flake8 on your Django app:

```bash
flake8 appname
```

This will check for PEP 8 violations and produce a report.

### 4. Formatting with Black
Black is an opinionated code formatter that enforces consistent formatting.

#### Format Code
To format your Django app code:

```bash
black appname
```

This will modify your files to conform to Black's formatting rules.

## Integrating with Git
### Pre-commit Hook
Add a pre-commit hook to ensure code quality checks before every commit.

#### Install Pre-commit

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

#### Create a Configuration File
Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: trailing-whitespace

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.9.1
    hooks:
      - id: black

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8

  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint
    rev: v3.0.1
    hooks:
      - id: pylint
```

#### Install Pre-commit Hooks
Run the following command to install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

From now on, code quality checks will run automatically before every commit.

## Integrating with Your IDE

### VSCode
1. Install the **Python** extension.
2. Configure formatters and linters in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "python.formatting.provider": "black",
  "python.linting.enabled": true,
  "python.linting.pylintEnabled": true,
  "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true
}
```

3. Enable auto-format on save:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true
}
```

### PyCharm
1. Go to **Preferences > Tools > File Watchers**.
2. Add **Black**, **Pylint**, and **Flake8** as external tools.
3. Configure them to run automatically on file changes.
